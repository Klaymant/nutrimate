      <summary>What are macronutrients?</summary>
      <p>
        <strong>Macronutrients</strong> are nutrients that are abundant in food. They bring energy to our body, physically and mentally.<br/>
        We generally use <b>kcal</b> or <b>kj</b> to quantify this energy.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are 3 macronutrients:
        <ul>
          <li>Proteins</li>
          <li>Fat</li>
          <li>Carbohydrates</li>
        </ul>      
      </p>

      <h2>Proteins</h2>
      <p>
        Proteins are <b>essential bricks for muscle building</b> as you may know but not only. They help <b>strengthen joints, bones, skin</b> and more.<br/>
        Furthermore they are used to <b>create hormones, enzymes, antibodies</b> and so on.
      </p>

      <h2>Carbohydrates</h2>
      <p>
        Carbohydrates (often abbreviated carbs) <b>are the main source of energy for the body</b>.<br/>
        They are used to <b>fuel the brain, kidneys, heart, muscles and central nervous system</b>.
      </p>

      <h2>Fat</h2>
      <p>
        Fat not only is a <b>great source of energy</b> but also <b>helps the body absorb vitamins</b>, <b>synthesize hormones</b>, <b>protect organs</b> and keep the body warm.
      </p>

      <summary>How macronutrient needs are calculated?</summary>
      <p>
        The calculation is based on the <strong>Basal Metabolic Rate</strong> (BMR) which is the amount of energy expended while at rest. On top of that, according to your physical goal and level of activity, different factors are used to adjust the result.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a nutshell, <b>the more active you are, the more protein ratio you need</b>. <b>The fat ratio is based on the weight</b>, it doesn't seem to be influenced that much by the activity level or by the physical goal. The <b>quantity of carbohydrates is calculated by substracting the calories from proteins and fat</b> since their major role is to bring energy unlike fat and proteins that have more specific roles in the body.
